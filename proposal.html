      <h3 id="Questionnaire">Questionnaire</h3>
        <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEAgJxpWvB0ZPYTocmi6QxGjB__kCj3osBzeKIy5oCLi2sDg/viewform?usp=sf_link">Questionnaire Google Form</a><p>
			<p>My questionnaire aimed to get a brief overview of some of the information I would include in my website in order to achieve the most influencial way of getting people to donate and give their time. I surveyed 10 specifically picked people and the results are displayed below:</p>
  
      <figure>
    <h4>What is your age?</h4>
    <img 
    src="Graph1.jpg" 
    alt="Graph1"
    >
    <p>Everyone who took the questionnaire was between 18 and 50</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Have you heard of the Sydney Children’s Hospitals foundation?</h4>
    <img 
    src="Graph2.jpg" 
    alt="Graph2"
    >
    <p>This was rather surpising that it was nearly 50/50 of people knowing about the Syndey Children's Hospital Foundation. This shows that maybe pushing it on social media or getting the word out more would be a useful strategy for this foundation.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h4>Have you had any experience/ been impacted by the Sydney Children’s Hospital Foundation or know of someone who has?</h4>
    <img 
    src="Graph3.jpg" 
    alt="Graph3"
    >
    <p>Most people had not been a part of this foundation which shows that there is many people out there that can be reached to be a part of this foundation.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Is this a foundation that you would consider supporting or signing up to?</h4>
    <img 
    src="Graph4.jpg" 
    alt="Graph4"
    >
    <p>This is a very pleasant statistic that everyone wants to support the Sydney Children's Hospital Foundation but I guess the problem is that they don't know where or how they can help. This shows that there is definitely a target audience for my website and there are users out there ready to become a part of this foundation.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Which of these would you do for the Sydney Children’s Hospital Foundation? Please select all applicable.</h4>
    <img 
    src="Graph5.jpg" 
    alt="Graph5"
    >
    <p>There is a broad range of answers for this question so giving the option to help out in each of these ways is necessary for my website development.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>What information would you want to know before you donated to this foundation? Please select all applicable.</h4>
    <img 
    src="Graph6.jpg" 
    alt="Graph6"
    >
    <p>Everyone who took this survey stated that they want to know various information before giving to this foundation so this information is vital for me to display on my website.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>If you were to donate to this foundation would you rather it just go wherever the foundation chooses or would you rather choose the particular part of the foundation you are donating to?</h4>
    <img 
    src="Graph7.jpg" 
    alt="Graph7"
    >
    <p>This question was one that I was interested in adding a feature letting the user choose which area to donate too. Most of the people were happy with it going whereever the foundation woudl use it so I will think about whether this feature is one which I will pursue in my final design.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Would you follow this foundation on social media to be informed on how you can help out or how this foundation is impacting our community?</h4>
    <img 
    src="Graph8.jpg" 
    alt="Graph8"
    >
    <p>Again, pushing the social media is a vital part of my website design.</p>

    <blockquote>

      <h4>User Profile #2</h4>

    alt="userprofile2"

    </figure>
			<blockquote>
				This group is taking the initiative to donate to this charity after knowing about it for wuite a while. They are not necessarily looking for information on the foundation, rather they are looking for information on what they can do to help this foundation.

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>To start developing my website design I first wanted to throw together some ideas with fonts, shapes, and colors just to think of some themes in the form of moodboards that I could use for my website development. As well as this, I started some initial ideation of the layout and design of my website through some rough sketches which put my thoughts onto paper from which I could expand and move onto developing wireframes and mockups of the design I chose.</p>
      <br>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
      <br>
    <figure>
    <img 
    src="Moodboard1.jpg" 
    alt="Moodboard"
    >
    </figure>
    <h4>Moodboard #1</h4>
    <p>My first moodboard encorporates a brighter color theme with a funky style. After consideration of this style I do not wish to use this in my website as it doesn't really catch my eye as an aesthetic design, as it lacks unity among the different fonts colors and shapes.</p>
    <br>
    <figure>
    <img 
    src="Moodboard2.jpg" 
    alt="Moodboard"
    >
    </figure>
    <h4>Moodboard #2</h4>
    <p>With this moodboard I went for a much quieter design with greens and purples trying to convey a sense of empathy. Although I do like this theme over the previous I still don't feel like this is the right design for the charity I have chosen.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <figure>
    <img 
    src="Moodboard3.jpg" 
    alt="Moodboard"
    >
    </figure>
		<h4>Moodboard #3</h4>
    <p>I really like the color theme of this moodboard as it seems sophisticated whilst still bright conveying a sense of hope. I like the symetry and geometry in this moodboard and I think that is something that I will encorporate in my next steps.</p>
    <br>
			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>To further develop my design and explore my concept I have created some initial sketches to ideate some website layouts and designs.</p>
    <h4>Homepage</h4>
    <figure>
    <img 
    src="Sketch1.jpg" 
    alt="Sketch"
    >
    <h4>Sign Up</h4>
    <img 
    src="Sketch2.jpg" 
    alt="Sketch"
    >
    <h4>Donate</h4>
    <img 
    src="Sketch3.jpg" 
    alt="Sketch"
    >
    </figure>
      In these sketches I tried to encorporate the themes in moodboard 3 using lots of geometery in the layout. These sketches are very simple but convey the most important points that I wish to convey to my target audience with a great salience brought to the key words such as 'donate' and 'sign up'. I didn't want to make the websites too confussing or compact otherwise it would draw away from the main message I am trying to convey.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="designs">
			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>I will continue to develop my website through the creation of wireframes and then mockup designs of a higher fidelity.</p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>The wireframes will give me an idea of the layout of my website design and help me to visualise where I will place all the information. The wireframes I have created are very simple as I wanted a simplistic design encorporating much symmetry and geometry.</p>
      <h4>Homepage</h4>
			<figure>
				<img 
    src="Wireframe1.jpg" 
    alt="Wireframe1"
    >
    </figure>
    <h4>Sign Up</h4>
			<figure>
				<img 
    src="Wireframe2.jpg" 
    alt="Wireframe2"
    >
    </figure>
    <h4>Donate</h4>
			<figure>
				<img 
    src="Wireframe3.jpg" 
    alt="Wireframe3"
    >
    </figure>
      <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
      <p>The mockups I have created for my design demonstrate a high fidelity of my website design proposal. I drew information from my questionnaire, sketches, and wireframes to come up with this final prototype designs for both desktop and mobile devices.</p>
    <h4>Desktop

    <h4>Mobile Device</h4>
